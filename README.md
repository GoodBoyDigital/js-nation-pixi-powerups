## setup (optional) ##

If you would like to use the set up build setup provided, follow these steps:

1. `npm install` - will install webpack and TS.

2. `npm start` - will build the code and watch for changes.

3. You will need to then serve the dist folder. Here's a tool for that if required: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
